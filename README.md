This repo contains data sets that were used for the #nacac19 Twitter Analytics. 

Data were pulled using the [rtweet](https://rtweet.info/) package developed by Mike Kearney and searched using the #nacac19 hastag. Additional variables and analysis were done by Brad Weiner. Mistakes and errors are his alone.

There are two files included. One is a .csv which should be machine readable by any number of languages. The second is .Rds for use in the R Statistical Computing Package. The .Rds is more robust and includes the original nested-list structure.
